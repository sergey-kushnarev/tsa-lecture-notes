## Welcome!

These are the lecture notes for **EN.553.439/639 Time Series Analysis**, based on the Cryer and Chen textbook "Time Series Analysis: With Applications in R" and Time Series Lecture notes of Dr Torcaso.

The notes are typed by Yue Wu. The notes are authored and maintained by [Sergey Kushnarev](about.qmd), and include:

- Topic summaries
- Mathematical derivations
- R code examples
- Figures and simulation results

> These notes are meant to supplement, not replace, in-class lectures and discussions.
> There are typos and errors in the notes. Please refer to the textbook and lecture materials for the most accurate information. Please email me (or consult TAs/me in the Office Hours) if you find any issues or have questions.
